            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at MSU Vadodara, where I'm
                diving deep into the exciting world of technology and innovation. My academic journey has fueled my
                passion for continuous learning and growth, especially in the realms of data analysis, data science, and
                software development.

            <p> With a keen interest in uncovering insights from data and a knack for problem-solving, I've embraced
                opportunities to expand my skill set and explore emerging trends in these fields. Whether it's through
                hands-on projects, coursework, or self-driven learning, I thrive on discovering new techniques and
                applying them to real-world challenges.</p>

            <p>In addition to my passion for data analysis and data science, I'm also excited about the prospect of
                building scalable and efficient software systems as a Software Development Engineer (SDE). I believe
                that SDEs play a critical role in bridging the gap between idea and implementation, and I'm eager to
                develop my skills in this area.</p>

            <p>My enthusiasm for data analysis, data science, and SDE drives me to stay updated with the latest tools
                and methodologies, aiming to leverage data to make informed decisions and drive impactful results. I am
                eager to contribute to dynamic teams where I can bring my analytical mindset, dedication to learning,
                and passion for technology to the table.</p>

            My goal is to leverage my technical skills and passion for learning to create impactful, cutting-edge
            software solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible in the tech industry.</p>

                <h3>Web Scraping Intern </h3>
                <h2>Company : Keshav Encon PVT limited </h2>
                <p class="date">June 2024 - Present</p>
                <p>Challenges faced : Is to scrap data from website where data change frequently.Solution i provided is
                    to used differnt technique to solve this challenge.
                    I had used manay Python libraries to solve it.
                </p>
                <p>During my internship at Keshav Encon, I worked on a project that involved web scraping using Python
                    and machine
                    learning models to provide personalized job recommendations to job seekers. I utilized various
                    Python libraries such as
                    Requests, Beautiful Soup, and Scikit-learn , Scrapy , Scrapr with Selenium to scrape job listings
                    from multiple websites and train
                    an ML model to recommend
                    jobs based on job seeker preferences and skills. Additionally, we will integrate the ML model with
                    an API
                    like ScrapingBee to scrape data from websites that required more advanced scraping capabilities.
                    This project allowed me to develop my skills in web scraping, data preprocessing,data cleaning,
                    and ML model training, and I was able to successfully work with the API to provide recommendations
                    to job seekers.</p>

                <h3> Customet Churn Prediction using Machine Learning</h3>
                <h2>Aim : This project is to predict customer churn in the telecom industry, enabling proactive
                    retention efforts to reduce customer attrition and improve business outcomes.</h2>
                <p>Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses, particularly in competitive industries
                    like telecommunications, where customer retention directly impacts revenue and growth. Customer
                    churn refers to the rate at which customers stop using a company’s products or services within a
                    specified period. Understanding why customers are leaving, and predicting churn rates, enables
                    companies to proactively address issues, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance customer
                    loyalty.

                    This project focuses on building a deep learning model to predict customer churn specifically within
                    the telecom sector. The model will analyze key factors contributing to customer churn, such as
                    service quality, customer support interactions, billing issues, usage patterns, and more. By
                    accurately predicting churn, telecom companies can identify at-risk customers and take targeted
                    actions to retain them</p>
